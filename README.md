# RoadSense

## Introduction

RoadSense is a cutting-edge system designed to enhance highway safety by integrating with existing CCTV cameras and utilizing machine learning to detect accidents. This system is dedicated to ensuring swift and efficient response to accidents, reducing the severity of incidents, and ultimately saving lives.

## Features

- **Accident Detection**: RoadSense employs advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze live camera feeds from existing CCTV cameras placed on highways. It can swiftly and accurately detect accidents, regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.

- **Real-time Alerts**: Once an accident is detected, RoadSense immediately sends real-time alerts to the concerned authorities. These alerts include precise accident location data, allowing first responders to reach the scene quickly.

- **Traffic Management**: RoadSense can provide real-time traffic data based on accident information. This can help authorities reroute traffic and minimize congestion caused by accidents, improving overall traffic flow.

- **Historical Data Analysis**: The system collects and stores historical accident data, which can be analyzed to identify accident-prone areas and patterns. This information can be used for future highway planning and safety improvements.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: RoadSense collects live camera feed data from existing CCTV cameras on highways.

2. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Advanced machine learning algorithms analyze the camera feeds in real-time, looking for signs of accidents such as sudden stops, collisions, or debris on the road.

3. **Accident Detection**: When an accident is detected, RoadSense triggers alerts, including the accident location, to the concerned authorities and emergency services if configured.

4. **Data Storage and Analysis**: Historical accident data is stored for future analysis, aiding in long-term safety improvements.

## Benefits

- **Improved Response Time**: Swift detection and notification of accidents enable faster response times for first responders, potentially saving lives.

- **Reduced Severity**: By detecting accidents early, RoadSense can help reduce the severity of accidents and minimize damage and injuries.

- **Traffic Flow Improvement**: Real-time traffic information allows for better traffic management, reducing congestion and improving highway efficiency.

- **Data-Driven Safety**: Historical data analysis can lead to targeted safety improvements on highways, making them safer for all users.

To install and configure RoadSense, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- Python and pip (Python Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.
- Access to the RoadSense GitHub repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install RoadSense. Then, clone the GitHub repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ABChapagain/roadsense
   ```

  

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned RoadSense repository:

   ```bash
   cd roadsense
   ```

3. **Install npm Packages**: Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install pip Packages**: RoadSense may require certain Python packages. To install these packages, create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it. Then, use pip to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install Python packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configuration**: RoadSense may require configuration for your specific environment and CCTV camera setup. Refer to the project's documentation or configuration files to set up the system according to your needs.

6. **Build and Start the Server**: Once you have installed the npm packages and configured the system, you can build and start the server using the following npm command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will build the project and start the server.

7. **Adding CCTV Cameras**: Follow the instructions provided in the project documentation to add CCTV cameras and configure their integration with RoadSense.

8. **Tracking Accidents**: Once the system is up and running with your CCTV cameras integrated, RoadSense will automatically track and detect accidents as described in the project's features.

9. **Additional Configuration**: Depending on your specific use case, you may need to further configure the system for advanced features or customizations. Refer to the project's documentation for details.

10. **Testing**: Before deploying RoadSense in a production environment, it's advisable to thoroughly test its functionality and ensure that it meets your requirements.

Now, RoadSense should be up and running, integrated with your CCTV cameras, and capable of detecting accidents and performing other specified tasks. Be sure to consult the project's documentation and seek support from the project maintainers if you encounter any issues or have specific questions about its configuration and usage.
